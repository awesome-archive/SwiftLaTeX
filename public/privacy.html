        <p> Please read this Privacy Agreement carefully, as it sets out, together with the <a href="eula.html">EULA</a>
            the basis upon which you, the User interacts with us, SWIFTLABS AUCKLAND LIMITED, the Licensor. By
            continuing to interact with us you agree to be bound by the provisions of this Privacy Agreement.
        </p>


        <p>
            SwiftLaTeX.com is a website run by SWIFTLABS AUCKLAND LIMITED that allows you to load our SwiftLaTeX
            editor, which is a client-side script running in your browser.
            The only server side code custom built for SwiftLaTex.com is put in place because certain cloud
            providers offer no other option to pass a required access token to the client side,
            and our server side code is designed to not hold the token past your current session.
            This is the only server side functionality beyond standard open-source software used to run a webserver
            with static websites with client side code.
        </p>


        <p> SwiftLaTeX.com does not keep data about you. <br/>
            The SwiftLaTeX server never learns anything about the personal data you are editing with the SwiftLaTeX
            editor.
            Our application code of Swiftlatex.com does not store any information about you between your visits to
            Swiftlatex.com. The standard open source software running on our servers, including the Nginx
            webserver, in their current configuration, do not store any personal or personalizable information about
            you to the best of our knowledge.
            We only reserve the right to do basic web page access analytics. We may also report uncaught exceptions
            in our Javascript codes to allow us to mitigate bugs.
        </p>
