        <p> Please read this End-User License Agreement (EULA) carefully, as it sets out, together with the <a
                href="privacy.html">Privacy Agreement</a> the basis upon which you, the User interacts with
            us, SWIFTLABS AUCKLAND LIMITED, the Licensor. By continuing to interact with us you agree to be
            bound by the provisions of this EULA.
        </p>


        <p> SwiftLaTeX is a free, fully automated service offered by SWIFTLABS AUCKLAND LIMITED to you, that
            lets you edit documents in LaTeX and (a) offers one particularly advanced feature of document
            engineering, namely a good implementation of true what-you-see-is-what-you-get(WYSIWYG) editing, as
            defined in research performed by our team, and (b) offers workable other features necessary to
            access the true WYSIWYG feature in a reasonably large number of use cases, such as editing a typical
            scientific article. Although in simple cases little or no prior knowledge of LaTeX might be
            sufficient to use SwiftLaTeX, usually a moderate knowledge of LaTeX easily obtainable from LaTeX
            online sources is expected from a User.
        </p>


        <p> We intend that our offer of an automated service is of use to you without human intervention from
            our side, we expect and accept no compensation or service from you. You agree that if you feel at
            any point that you are about to perform an action that entitles you now or later to any reciprocal
            action from us or puts us under any obligation, then you abstain from that action and either cease
            to interact with our site completely or only continue to interact in such a manner that does not put
            us under any obligation.
        </p>


        <p> The User must not sell, resell, rent, lease, loan, supply, publish, distribute or redistribute the
            Software. The User must not alter, edit or adapt the Software. The User must not decompile,
            de-obfuscate or reverse engineer, or attempt to decompile, de-obfuscate or reverse engineer, the
            Software. </p>


        <p>
            The software is a beta version provided “as is”; the Licensor may <b>not provide maintenance</b>.
            the Licensor may <b>not provide documentation</b> beyond the web resources present at time of
            entering this agreement. The Licensor may <b>not provide support</b> and may not answer to requests.
        </p>

        <p> The User acknowledges that complex software is never wholly free from defects, errors and bugs; and

        </p>


        <p> Duration of the EULA and future changes to the Privacy agreement:<br/>
            Since you do not have any account with SwiftLaTeX.com you are accepting the current EULA with
            SWIFTLABS AUCKLAND LIMITED with each visit. Since we do not have your email address you agree that
            is sufficient for us to update the date information with the label 'last changed' at the top of this
            agreement to notify you about changes to the EULA.
